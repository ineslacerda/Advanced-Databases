# Advanced-Databases
- Created Python3 scripts that generate tables in PotgreSQL and perform ETL loads (i.e., folder "FKlub") for a real-life case study. This is a case study for the F-klubben, a social association for students and staff in the department of Computer Science at Aalborg University. Furthermore, cubes using Mondrian were created (i.e., folder "Cubes"), and data was analyzed to reach conclusions and suggestions for future business improvements.

### Execute Project:
- Create PostgreSQL tables by running "python3 tables.py"
- Perform ETL loads by running "python3 load.py"
